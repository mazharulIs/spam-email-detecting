# spam-email-detecting
motivation:
  Actually,in this technology based world many email are sent to us.But many of them are spams which are very detrimental to our personal data.
  To solve this problem,I have tried to make a simple project to detect the received email whether it is ham(good) or spam (bad) email.
Feature:
   as it is a simple project,if any email is put on the text bar,it shows whether it is spam or ham email
